## Overview
This project focuses on developing machine learning models for two key applications:

1. **Phishing Email Detection**: A model designed to classify emails as phishing or legitimate based on textual features and email metadata.
2. **Obesity Risk Classification**: A multi-class classification model to assess obesity risk levels (0 to 6) based on demographic, lifestyle, and family history factors.

## Project Goals
- Build a robust ML model to detect phishing emails using supervised learning techniques.
- Develop an obesity classification model considering variables such as gender, age, lifestyle habits, and family history.
- Utilize data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Data Sources
- **Phishing Detection**: Dataset containing labeled email samples with various features.
- **Obesity Classification**: Dataset comprising demographic details, lifestyle choices, and family health background.

## Methodology
### 1. Phishing Email Detection
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction (NLP techniques, metadata analysis)
- Model Selection (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.)
- Performance Evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

### 2. Obesity Risk Classification
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training (Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC)

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- SQL Server Management Studio 20 for database management
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for experimentation

## Expected Outcomes
- A functional phishing detection model that enhances email security.
- A reliable obesity classification model that assists in preventive healthcare measures.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve phishing detection by incorporating deep learning techniques.
- Expand obesity classification with more diverse datasets and feature engineering.

## How to Run
1. Install required dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Run data preprocessing scripts (`python preprocess.py`).
3. Train the models (`python train.py`).
4. Evaluate and visualize results (`python evaluate.py`).
